# Battle of the Neighborhoods - Report

## Introduction/Business Problem
In this project, we will open a new high-end Chinese restaurant in the city of Chicago, Illinois. Chicago is known worldwide for its food, and much of it is rooted in Italian cuisine, deep dish pizza being the primary example. However, Chicago is also incredibly diverse, with major Polish, Chinese, Arabic, Korean and other neighborhoods.

The biggest challenge is that the restaurant scene in Chicago is very saturated. So we will be taking a look at Chicago's demographic data to determine the best location to open the business. In order to come to a conclusion, we need to determine which neighborhoods lack Chinese food options, which areas are most similar to those where Chinese restaurants thrive, and which of our remaining areas are the most affluent.

## Methodology

I started by pulling the demographic data for Chicago. In order to pull data from Foursquare and match the restaurants to the neighborhoods, I added a column for the latitude and longitude for each column
After exploring the data, I could see that it required a small amount of cleaning. First, the neighborhood Montclare was misspelled as "Montclaire," while Washington Heights was missing the "s" at the end of its name.
There was also a "total" row at the bottom that showed demographic information for Chicago as a whole. This was removed from the data set.

I used Nominatim to retrieve the latitude and longitude for each of the neighborhoods. The coordinates where then fed into the Foursquare API in order to pull all venues in a radius of 1 kilometer.
By having the total venues in each neighborhood, I could then segment the neighbrohoods into different clusters to determine which ones were most similar to each other.

By using one hot encoding, I averaged out the numbers for each venue and used K-means clustering to segment the neighborhoods. The clustering result showed 3 distinct groups (clusters 0, 1 and 3)
along with 2 other clusters that were so different from the rest that they were classified into their own groups (clusters 2 and 4).

Cluster 2, consisting solely of Riverdale, is one of Chicago's poorest neighborhoods. With a per capita income of just over $8,000 per year, it was determined to be a bad fit for an upscale restaurant.
Likewise, cluster 4 was only made up of South Deering, which is a heavily industrial area that would not be a good fit either.

From a quick look at the data, it's clear that the neighborhoods in Cluster 1
are a good fit for a Chinese restaurant. However, since we are opening an "upscale" Chinese restaurant, community areas with a per capita income of under $40,000 per year will not be considered.

The next thing to look at was the current saturation of each neighborhood. We obviously don't want to open up yet another Chinese restaurant if there are already several in the area. Since the sizes
of the neighborhoods are very different, we will consider the ratio of Chinese  restaurants to population. The population data was pulled from the Wikipedia page and merged into our dataset. Then, from our earlier
Foursquare report, I added the number of Chinese restaurants per neighborhood and added the number in a new column.

We then needed to find out how many people would be in each neighborhood per Chinese restaurant if one more (ours) were to open in the area. To get an even better idea of where we should open the restaurant,
I multiplied the population per Chinese restaurant by the per capita income, and then reduced this by the percentage of the population that is out of our target age range (under 18 and older than 64). The results became clear.

## Results
After looking at market saturation, The Near North Side emerged as the front runner. It was closely followed by Lake View,.

In any way the results are read, it's clear that Near North Side would be the best neighborhood to open the restaurant.

## Discussion
Foursquare reports that there are no Chinese Restaurants in the Near North Side. This means that there is plenty of opportunity, since we are opening a high-end restaurant in the richest neighborhood of Chicago.

## Conclusion
Based on the data, I recommend that any high-end Chinese restaurant opens in the Near North Side. The neighborhood has the highest income per capita at over $88,000. As a fallback, Lakeview would be an excellent second choice.
