# Battle of the Neighborhoods - Part 1

## Introduction/Business Problem
In this project, we will open a new high-end Chinese restaurant in the city of Chicago, Illinois. Chicago is known worldwide for its food, and much of it is rooted in Italian cuisine, deep dish pizza being the primary example. However, Chicago is also incredibly diverse, with major Polish, Chinese, Arabic, Korean and other neighborhoods.

The biggest challenge is that the restaurant scene in Chicago is very saturated. So we will be taking a look at Chicago's demographic data to determine the best location to open the business. In order to come to a conclusion, we need to determine which neighborhoods lack Chinese food options, which areas are most similar to those where Chinese restaurants thrive, and which of our remaining areas are the most affluent.
